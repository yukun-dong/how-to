## Why I need to Provision or local debug

This section introduces different situations you need to provision your project. If you are suggested by the Toolkit to provision your project, check whether you are one of them.

1. If your project has not been successfully provisioned yet and you choose to deploy or publish it, toolkit will ask you to provision first.
2. If your project has not been successfully provisioned yet, and you choose to validate manifest or build Teams app package, or publish the app, toolkit will ask you to provision first to generate the values to fill out certain field in manifest template.
3. If your project has not been successfully provisioned or local debug yet, and you choose to "Deploy Azure Active Directory app manifest", toolkit will ask you to provision or local debug first to create a new AAD app.
4. If your project contains bot capability which has already been successfully provisioned and just got upgrade by Toolkit, the project requires re-provision bot resource. Since Bot Channels Registration become a [legacy production](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=userassigned#create-the-resource), toolkit helps upgrade Bot Channels Registration to Azure Bot Service, so you will be asked to provision again before deploy or publish the project. If you still want to use existing bot, please follow [these steps](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Upgrade-project-to-use-latest-Toolkit-features#manual-work-to-use-existing-bot).
